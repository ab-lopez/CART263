Under the Sea

Hi! This is my data visualization project! My project is about 
coral bleaching around the world from the years 1983-2005 and
how it's a major threat to our oceans and its ecosystems.

When the file is first loaded, it depicts a vibrant coral reef,
drawn all with vector points. As time passes, however, the image
begins to be disrupted by squares representing coral bleach. This
is where the data visualization comes in! The data is taken from a csv
file, and each square represents a different coral site and the percentage of
coral that has been bleached at that site. The squares appear one by one in chronological
order, from 1983 and so on and so forth (there is no exact number of squares that correlate
to the years because the study chooses different amounts of sites to examine per year, it
fluctuates).

I'm pretty happy with it! I'd like to make the order of squares appearing to be more
random while still keeping the tie in to the date, but I think that it's a good visualization
of the data and really represents/symbolizes how coral reefs â€“ these really beautiful ecosystems
(That are also animals! Coral is not a plant or a weird rock of some sort or an inanimate object
of some sort, they're invertebrates! When they're bleached those are animals that are fully dead!!
I'm very passionate about coral reefs if you couldn't tell) are dying off due to changing temperatures
of the sea.

The file is from the following study:

Yay, coral! :D
