Tic Tac Toe

I'm bad at tic tac toe. This is a tic tac toe game! Kachow.

I use the concept of a magic square to keep track of whether a player has reached three squares or not.

I couldn't figure out how to get it to reset. I'm sure there's an easier way
to do this without the magic square, and I'm sure I could figure out how to 
make it reset and keep score if I had a counter variable or something,
but without looking up the answer I don't know how to do it :/

Glad the base game works tho! Wahoo :D
