# Particles w/ Personalities

Prompt: Lonely and Sad

Initial thoughts: tears slowly dripping down. Droplets that ripple outward. A tumultuous ocean. 

There's a bigger particle that is "crying", slow droplets that drip down and eventually fall to the "ocean" of particles below. Each drop causes a huge change in the ocean, making a tiny addition the cause of a huge impact.

It's interactive, but it's not. They are lonely and sad. You can't help them. You can never help them. There's a quiet sniffling in the background. Heavy breathing. They sound close to tears. Everytime you click on them, the sound gets worse, the tears fall quicker. You can't help them. You can never help them. You will only make it worse.
