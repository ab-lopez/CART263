# Particles w/ Personalities

Title: Triggering Dissociation
Abigail Lopez 40203553
Prompt: Lonely and Sad

Initial brainstorming thoughts: tears slowly dripping down. Droplets that ripple outward. A tumultuous ocean. 

There's a bigger particle that is "crying", slow droplets that drip down and eventually fall to the "ocean" of particles below. Each drop causes a huge change in the ocean, making a tiny addition the cause of a huge impact.

It's interactive, but it's not. They are lonely and sad. You can't help them. You can never help them. There's a quiet sniffling in the background. Heavy breathing. They sound close to tears. Everytime you click on them, the sound gets worse, the tears fall quicker. You can't help them. You can never help them. You will only make it worse.

My prompt was "lonely and sad". I really wanted to emulate
the feeling of being lonely and sad and full of despair and
really capture what it feels like to dissociate, when everything
feels so bleak and meaningless.

For me, images of a relentless ocean, dripping water (my friend
brought up the idea of Chinese water torture, which I had never
considered but I think it's a cool idea to mention here), and the
static in your head as you feel worse and worse and worse.

Also got some help with displaying the gradients from chatGPT. 
Thank you AI for taking over the world.
